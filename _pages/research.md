## Medical Image Analysis
Here are some topics that we are working on:
* Clinics/PET/CT – Survival.

* Pathomics – Survival Analysis.

* Treatment Recommendation.

* Difference analysis from PET.

* Rapid Response System (RRS).

## Multimodal Emotion

Currently, we focus on analyzing mental health states (pain, stress, ...), cognitive load from multimodal data, including audio, visual, biological signals. Here are some achievements in the past few years:
