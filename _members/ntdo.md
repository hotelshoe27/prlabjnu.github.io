I am currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in the Pattern Recognition Lab, Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, Korea. I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Science from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam National University, Vietnam in 2010 and 2013. Since 2011, I have worked at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology as a Lecturer. My research interests include natural language processing, pattern recognition, and medical image processing.

I received the B.S. in Information System major from HCM City University of Foreign Language – Information Technology, Vietnam in 2005 and M.S. in Information System Management from International University, Vietnam National University at HCMC, Viet Nam in 2017. From 2005 to 2017, I was a lecturer in Faculty of Information Technology, HCM University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology, Vietnam. Since 2017, he is Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, Korea. His research interests are pattern recognition, deep learning, computer vision, and parallel programming.
