I obtained my BSc degree from the Department of Mathematics and Computer science, University of Mkar, Nigeria in 2019. I am currently pursuing my Masters degree at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea, and I joined the Pattern Recognition Lab in March 2022. My research interest is in Medical Image analysis and Pattern Recognition.
